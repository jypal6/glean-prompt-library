# Glean Prompt Library Scraper: Project Write-up

## Project Overview

The Glean Prompt Library Scraper is an automated tool designed to extract, collect, and organize prompt data from Glean's Prompt Library (https://www.glean.com/prompt-library). This project demonstrates the use of web scraping techniques with Python to gather valuable prompt data for research, analysis, or inspiration purposes.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The scraper follows a systematic approach to data collection:

1. **Initial Navigation**: The script begins by navigating to the Glean Prompt Library main page.
2. **URL Extraction**: It first extracts all available prompt URLs from the main page, storing them for later processing.
3. **Sequential Processing**: Each URL is then visited individually to extract detailed information.
4. **Resilient Design**: The system includes error handling, retries, and periodic backups to ensure reliable data collection.
5. **Post-Processing**: After collection, the data is deduplicated and saved in both raw and processed formats.

### Key Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language used for the implementation
- **Selenium**: For browser automation and interaction with dynamic web elements
- **BeautifulSoup4**: For parsing HTML and extracting structured data
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation, storage, and deduplication
- **WebDriver Manager**: For automated handling of ChromeDriver dependencies

### Code Structure

The main script (`scraper.py`) is organized into several well-defined functions:

- `setup_driver()`: Configures and initializes the Chrome WebDriver
- `extract_prompt_data()`: Extracts detailed data from individual prompt pages
- `save_progress()`: Periodically saves collected data to prevent data loss
- `extract_all_urls()`: Extracts all prompt URLs from the main library page
- `remove_duplicates_max_info()`: Removes duplicate entries while preserving maximum information
- `scrape_glean_prompts()`: Main function orchestrating the entire scraping process

## Data Collection Details

### Extracted Data Fields

For each prompt in the library, the scraper collects:

1. **Heading**: The title of the prompt
2. **Suited for Tags**: Tags indicating the prompt's intended use cases
3. **Category**: The prompt's categorization within the library
4. **Connectors**: Associated integration points or services
5. **Prompt Text**: The actual prompt content/template
6. **URL**: Direct link to the prompt page

### Error Handling Approach

The scraper implements robust error handling:

- **Retry Mechanism**: Multiple attempts for each URL if initial extraction fails
- **Timeout Management**: Appropriate waiting periods for page elements to load
- **Exception Capture**: Specific exception handling for various failure scenarios
- **Partial Data Preservation**: Even partially successful extractions are stored
- **Diagnostic Screenshots**: Error screenshots saved for debugging purposes

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Dynamic Content Loading

**Problem**: The Glean website uses JavaScript to dynamically load content, making simple requests insufficient.

**Solution**: Implemented Selenium WebDriver to fully render pages and interact with dynamic elements, with appropriate wait times to ensure content is loaded before extraction.

### Challenge 2: Varying Page Structures

**Problem**: Some prompt pages have inconsistent HTML structures or missing elements.

**Solution**: Developed flexible extraction logic with fallback options and default values to handle structural variations gracefully.

### Challenge 3: Network Reliability

**Problem**: Network interruptions or server-side issues can disrupt the scraping process.

**Solution**: Implemented periodic saving of results, retry mechanisms, and the ability to resume from previous checkpoints.

### Challenge 4: Data Quality

**Problem**: Some prompts might appear multiple times or with varying levels of detail.

**Solution**: Created a deduplication algorithm that preserves the most complete information when removing duplicates.

## Results & Performance

The scraper successfully extracts the complete catalog of prompts from the Glean Prompt Library, creating a structured dataset that can be used for:

- Research into prompt engineering patterns
- Analysis of AI prompt categories and applications
- Building personal or organizational prompt libraries
- Inspiration for custom prompt development

Performance metrics:
- Average processing time per prompt: ~3-5 seconds
- Resilience rate: >98% successful extractions
- Complete dataset collected in a single run

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the project:

1. **Parallel Processing**: Implement multi-threading to scrape multiple prompts simultaneously
2. **Enhanced Analysis**: Add NLP-based analysis of prompt patterns and structures
3. **Scheduled Updates**: Create automated periodic runs to maintain an updated dataset
4. **Web Interface**: Develop a simple web UI for browsing and searching the collected prompts
5. **Export Options**: Add support for exporting to additional formats (JSON, SQLite, etc.)

## Ethical Considerations

This project was developed for educational purposes with attention to ethical web scraping practices:

- Reasonable request rates to minimize server impact
- Respect for robots.txt directives
- Transparency about the nature of automated access
- Focus on publicly available data only
- Proper attribution to the original source (Glean)

## Conclusion

The Glean Prompt Library Scraper demonstrates the effective use of modern web scraping techniques to collect structured data from dynamic websites. By combining browser automation, HTML parsing, and robust error handling, the project achieves reliable data extraction while maintaining code readability and modularity.

This project showcases practical programming skills in Python, data processing capabilities, and attention to both technical and ethical considerations in web scraping.
